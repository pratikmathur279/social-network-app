        <p>My name is Pratik Mathur. I am a web developer, currently working at Total Mortgage Services, LLC. My journey as a developer started at the age of 14, where I was introduced to the concepts of web development such as HTML and CSS. After that, I got my Bachelors and Master’s degree in Computer Science. This has helped me widen my range of knowledge and gather experiences in the field of Web Development. </p>
        <p>Constantly seeking to improve my skillset, I thrive on learning new web technologies in my spare time through online resources such as udemy.com and coursera.org, as well as diving head-first into new and unfamiliar projects.</p>
        <p> In my spare time, you’ll find me playing video games, playing soccer and learning new programming languages.</p>
